# 📊 Real-World SQL Practice Project on HR Dataset

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates practical SQL skills using a real-world HR dataset. 
It simulates the type of queries a Data Analyst might write on a daily basis using **Microsoft SQL Server**. 
From importing data, exploring it, writing complex queries, to exporting insights — this project covers the complete workflow.

---

## ✅ What I Did

- ✔️ Imported the HR dataset (`HRDataset_v14.csv`) into **Microsoft SQL Server**
- ✔️ Explored the structure using `SELECT TOP 10`
- ✔️ Wrote **10 practical SQL queries** including filtering, grouping, window functions, subqueries, and views
- ✔️ Exported query results to Excel for basic chart creation
- ✔️ Saved all SQL queries with comments explaining each step
- ✔️ Organized everything into folders and created this professional README
- ✔️ Getting ready to upload project to **GitHub** and share on **LinkedIn**

## 📁 Dataset Used
- **Name**: HRDataset_v14.csv
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Human Resources Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set)
- **Imported with**: SQL Server Import Wizard

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS)
- Excel (for charts and exports)
- GitHub (for sharing the project)

---

## 📘 Skills Practiced
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
- GROUP BY with COUNT(), AVG()
- Subqueries (scalar)
- Window Functions (RANK, PARTITION BY)
- Data exploration and reporting
- View creation for modular queries

## 🔢 Task List

| No | Task |
|----|------|
| 01 | Preview top 10 employee records |
| 02 | Count employees per department |
| 03 | Calculate average salary by department |
| 04 | List employees earning more than average |
| 05 | Rank employees by salary in each department |
| 06 | Gender-wise employee count |
| 07 | Attrition count by department |
| 08 | Average age by department |
| 09 | Top 5 highest paid employees |
| 10 | Created SQL view for attrition summary |

## 📊 Sample Output

Data exported to Excel and used to create:
- Bar chart: Employees per department
- Pie chart: Gender distribution
- Table: Top 5 salaries with ranks

⚠️ Challenges Faced
🧩	Challenge	How You Solved It
❌ Invalid object/table name	"Employees" table was missing	Identified actual table name as HRDataset_v14
❌ No clear structure	Didn't know what queries to write first	Followed a structured 10-task plan
❌ README writing	First time writing a project summary	Used a professional README template
❌ Visualizing results	Wanted charts for analysis	Exported SQL output to Excel and created graphs

🚧 Future Challenges I Might Face
🚀	Challenge	Why It Matters
🔄 Cleaning messy data in SQL	Handling nulls, blanks, and duplicates	Real datasets are not always clean
🧩 Multi-table JOINs	Combining 3+ related tables	Common in real-time reporting
📈 Building dashboards (Power BI/Tableau)	Visual storytelling	Most analyst jobs expect visualization
🧪 Solving case studies	Answering business questions with data	Helps in analytics interviews
🧬 Combining SQL with Python or Excel VBA	Cross-tool analysis	Useful in most analyst roles
